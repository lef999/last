I’m still a beginner, but I’m super motivated to keep learning and improving. My goal is to become a master web developer, gain solid experience, and eventually start my own consulting company. I know it’ll take time, but I’m ready for the journey!

This bootcamp made me love tech even more! Learning how the web works—from frontend to backend—has been eye-opening, and I can’t wait to build more real projects and sharpen my skills.

Next Steps:

Keep coding & build more projects
Learn advanced web technologies
Gain real experience before starting my consulting business
